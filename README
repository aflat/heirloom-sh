Initial code was written bt Gunnar Ritter, you can find it here:
http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/sh.html

I imported it into github so I can change it up a bit to work on
a more modern OS, Centos 6.6 x86_64 I have included the original 
README contents, but I can't vouch for their correctness


-------------Original README contents below-----------
